Dashboard Pages
---------------

(1) Home Page
-------------
-> This is an introductory page with a large Zomato logo and the word "Dashboard." It features a dynamic, illustrated background of various food items like noodles, shrimp, and vegetables, all set against a red backdrop.


(2) Overview Page
-----------------
-> This is the main analytics page, which provides a high-level summary of the business.

-> Key Metrics (KPIs): Four prominent cards display key figures:

* Amount: The total sales value (e.g., "414M," "987M").
* Quantity: The total number of items sold (e.g., "1M," "2M").
* Ratings: The total number of ratings given by users (e.g., "61K," "148K").
* Orders: The total number of orders placed (e.g., "62K," "150K").

-> There are also "Amount" and "Quantity" buttons, which likely toggle between these two views for the underlying data.

-> Category Performance: Three cards show the performance of different food categories:

-> Non-Veg: Displays total sales amount and ratings for non-vegetarian food.

-> Veg: Displays total sales amount and ratings for vegetarian food.

-> Others: Displays sales amount and ratings for other food types.

-> Geographic Data: A bar chart titled "All City Amount" shows a ranking of top cities by total sales amount.

-> Yearly Trends: A line chart shows the "Yearly Trends" of "Sale Value" from 2017 to 2020. The values are plotted, and in the screenshots, the data for 2018 is highlighted.


(3) User Performance Page
-------------------------
-> This page focuses on user-related metrics.

-> Key Metrics (KPIs): The four main KPI cards are present again, with "Active Users" and "Total Users" replacing "Amount" and "Quantity." The numbers for ratings and orders remain consistent.

-> Customer Gains & Losses: Two horizontal bar charts show "Gained Customers" and "Lost Customers," broken down by gender (Male and Female).

-> Users by Age: A histogram-like bar chart displays the distribution of users by age, from the teens to people in their 30s and beyond.


(4) City Performance Page 
-------------------------
-> This page provides a more detailed geographical breakdown of performance.

-> Key Metrics (KPIs): The main KPI cards are again present, showing "Amount," "Quantity," "Ratings," and "Orders."

-> Geographic Visualization: A world map is present in the background, though it is a static image.

-> City-Specific Data: A table lists cities and their corresponding "Sales" and "Orders" figures.

-> Rankings by City: Three horizontal bar charts rank cities based on different metrics:

* "Sales by City"
* "Ratings by City"
* "Active Users by City"

-> The rankings in all three charts appear to be different, highlighting different strengths in various cities.


-> Overall, the dashboard is well-structured and provides a comprehensive view of Zomato's business performance across different dimensions: sales, orders, user behavior, and geographic performance. 
-> The navigation sidebar on the left with icons for home, money, charts, and settings suggests a clear and user-friendly structure.
